Case Report: Intraarticular Iliopsoas Tendon causes Groin Pain Following Periacetabular Osteotomy.
[Minimally invasive periacetabular osteotomy for adult hip dysplasia]
Combined distal femoral osteotomy and tibial tuberosity distalization is effective in patients presenting with patellar instability and patellofemoral pain due to patella alta and femoral malalignment.
Prone Apprehension Relocation Test significantly correlates with radiological instability scores of the hip.
Revision lateralization osteotomy of the tibial tubercle has excellent outcomes in patients suffering from previous medial tibial tubercle overcorrection.
