Anti-necrotic and cardioprotective effects of a cytosolic renin isoform under ischemia-related conditions.
(Pro)renin receptor (ATP6AP2) depletion arrests As4.1 cells in the G0/G1 phase thereby increasing formation of primary cilia.
Mitochondrial functions of THP-1 monocytes following the exposure to selected natural compounds.
An Alternative Promoter in Intron1 of the Renin Gene is Regulated by Glucose Starvation via Serum Response Factor.
An alternative renin isoform is cardioprotective by modulating mitochondrial metabolism.
Non-secretory renin reduces oxidative stress and increases cardiomyoblast survival during glucose and oxygen deprivation.
Angiotensin dependent and angiotensin independent protective effects of renin-b in H9c2 cells after anoxia.
Overexpression of Transcripts Coding for Renin-b but Not for Renin-a Reduce Oxidative Stress and Increase Cardiomyoblast Survival under Starvation Conditions.
Overexpression of Renin-B Induces Warburg-like Effects That Are Associated with Increased AKT/mTOR Signaling.
