Micropatterned array to assess the interaction of single platelets with platelet factor 4-heparin-IgG complexes.
Characterisation of the conformational changes in platelet factor 4 induced by polyanions: towards in vitro prediction of antigenicity.
Amplification of bacteria-induced platelet activation is triggered by Fc?RIIA, integrin ?IIb?3 and platelet factor 4.
New insights in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia by the use of fluid-phase assays to detect specifically platelet factor 4/heparin complex antibodies and antibody-secreting cells.
Binding of anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies depends on the thermodynamics of conformational changes in platelet factor 4.
Pneumococcal Adhesins PavB and PspC Are Important for the Interplay with Human Thrombospondin-1.
Partially desulfated heparin modulates the interaction between anti-protamine/heparin antibodies and platelets.
Further insights into the anti-PF4/heparin IgM immune response.
Polyphosphates form antigenic complexes with platelet factor 4 (PF4) and enhance PF4-binding to bacteria.
