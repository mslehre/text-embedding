Sphingomyelin depletion from plasma membranes of human airway epithelial cells completely abrogates the deleterious actions of S. aureus alpha-toxin
S. aureus alpha-toxin monomer binding and heptamer formation in host cell membranes - Do they determine sensitivity of airway epithelial cells toward the toxin?
