Cathepsin B-mediated Activation of Trypsinogen in Endocytosing Macrophages Increases Severity of Pancreatitis in Mice.
NLRP3 Inflammasome activation in macrophages regulates systemic Inflammation and severity during acute pancreatitis
Adaptive immune Response during acute pancreatitis is regulated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Interleukin 18
NLRP3 Inflammasome Regulates Development of Systemic Inflammatory Respoes in Mice With Acute Pancreatitis.

Macrophage-derived cytokines of the IL1 Family simultaneously regulate pro-and anti-Inflammation during severe acute pancreatitis
The depletion of Foxp3+/CD25+ regulatory T cells drives a Th2 immune Response and reduces severity in a mouse model of acute pancreatitis
Experimental pancreatitis is characterized by rapid T cell activation, Th2 differentiation that parallels disease severity, and improvement after CD4 T cell depletion.
