Root phenology unresponsive to earlier snowmelt despite advanced above?ground phenology in two subarctic plant communities
Autumnal warming does not change root phenology in two contrasting vegetation types of subarctic tundra
Proportion of fine roots, but not plant biomass allocation below ground, increases with elevation in arctic tundra
Winter warming effects on tundra shrub performance are species?specific and dependent on spring conditions
Short?term climate change manipulation effects do not scale up to long?term legacies: effects of an absent snow cover on boreal forest plants
The hidden season: growing season is 50% longer below than above ground along an arctic elevation gradient
