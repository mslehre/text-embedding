Cold atmospheric plasma treatment induces anti-proliferative effects in prostate cancer cells by redox and apoptotic signaling pathways.
Inhibition of Cell Growth of the Prostate Cancer Cell Model LNCaP by Cold Atmospheric Plasma
Cytochrome P450 17A1 inhibitor abiraterone attenuates cellular growth of prostate cancer cells independently from androgen receptor signaling by modulation of oncogenic and apoptotic pathways.
Lysophosphatidic acid receptor isoforms expression in prostate cancer cells is differentially regulated by the CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone and depends on the androgen receptor
