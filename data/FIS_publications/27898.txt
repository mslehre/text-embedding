Partially desulfated heparin modulates the interaction between anti-protamine/heparin antibodies and platelets.
Human neutrophil antigen-3a antibodies induce neutrophil stiffening and conformational activation of CD11b without shedding of L-selectin.
Further insights into the anti-PF4/heparin IgM immune response.
Serotype 3 pneumococci sequester platelet-derived human thrombospondin-1 via the adhesin and immune evasion protein Hic.
