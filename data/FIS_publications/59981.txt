Increased Soil Frost Versus Summer Drought as Drivers of Plant Biomass Responses to Reduced Precipitation: Results from a Globally Coordinated Field Experiment
Early stage litter decomposition across biomes
Temporal photoperiod sensitivity and forcing requirements for budburst in temperate tree seedlings
Trait variation in response to varying winter temperatures, diversity patterns and signatures of selection along the latitudinal distribution of the widespread grassland plant Arrhenatherum elatius
Plant responses to climatic extremes: within?species variation equals among?species variation
Nitrogen leaching is enhanced after a winter warm spell but mainly controlled by vegetation composition in temperate zone mesocosms
Winter warming is ecologically more relevant than summer warming in a cool-temperate grassland
