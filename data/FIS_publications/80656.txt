Adaptive immune Response during acute pancreatitis is regulated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Interleukin 18
Non classical macrophage polarization regulates the immune response during acute pancreatitis
Macrophage-derived cytokines of the IL1 Family simultaneously regulate pro-and anti-Inflammation during severe acute pancreatitis
The depletion of Foxp3+/CD25+ regulatory T cells drives a Th2 immune Response and reduces severity in a mouse model of acute pancreatitis
Interleukin 33 regulates Th2 T-cell Differentiation and macrophage polarization during acute pancreatitis
Experimental pancreatitis is characterized by rapid T cell activation, Th2 differentiation that parallels disease severity, and improvement after CD4 T cell depletion.
Immunsuppression during severe acute pancreatitis is associated with a dramatic shift in intestinal microbiota composition and infected necrosis
Depletion of CD25+/FoxP3+ regulatory T cells increases fibrosis in a chronic model of pancreatitis
The way to infected necrosis during severe acute pancreatitis: How regulatory T-cells impact on the intestinal barrier function
In mouse chronic pancreatitis CD25FOXP3 regulatory T cells control pancreatic fibrosis by suppression of the type 2 immune response.
