Impact of priming on the response of neutrophils to human neutrophil alloantigen-3a antibodies.
HNA antibody-mediated neutrophil aggregation is dependent on serine protease activity.
Mass spectrometric phosphoproteome analysis of small-sized samples of human neutrophils
Mass spectrometric phosphoproteome analysis of small-sized samples of human neutrophils
Human neutrophil antigen-3a antibodies induce neutrophil stiffening and conformational activation of CD11b without shedding of L-selectin.
