Etiology and Risk Factors of Acute and Chronic Pancreatitis.
New horizons in pancreatic genetics
Immunsuppression during severe acute pancreatitis is associated with a dramatic shift in intestinal microbiota composition and infected necrosis
Immunoproteasome impairment via ?5i/LMP7-deletion leads to sustained pancreatic injury from experimental pancreatitis.
The Inhibitory Response to PI3K/AKT Pathway Inhibitors MK-2206 and Buparlisib Is Related to Genetic Differences in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines.
Inhibitory Response to CK II Inhibitor Silmitasertib and CDKs Inhibitor Dinaciclib Is Related to Genetic Differences in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines.
HLA-DRB1?16 and -DQB1?05 alleles are strongly associated with autoimmune pancreatitis in a cohort of hundred patients.
