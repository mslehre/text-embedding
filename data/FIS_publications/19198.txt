Anti-necrotic and cardioprotective effects of a cytosolic renin isoform under ischemia-related conditions.
(Pro)renin receptor (ATP6AP2) depletion arrests As4.1 cells in the G0/G1 phase thereby increasing formation of primary cilia.
An Alternative Promoter in Intron1 of the Renin Gene is Regulated by Glucose Starvation via Serum Response Factor.
Non-secretory renin reduces oxidative stress and increases cardiomyoblast survival during glucose and oxygen deprivation.
