Androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor ErbB3-binding protein-1 (Ebp1) is not targeted by the newly identified AR controlling signaling axis heat-shock protein HSP27 and microRNA miR-1 in prostate cancer cells.
Heat-shock Protein HSPB1 attenuates microRNA mir-1 Expression thereby restoring oncogenic pathways in prostate cancer cells
