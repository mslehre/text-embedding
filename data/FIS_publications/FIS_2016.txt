Lack of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 improves muscle force characteristics and attenuates fibrosis in dystrophic mdx mouse muscle
Comparative Label-Free Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Mildly versus Severely Affected mdx Mouse Skeletal Muscles Identifies Annexin, Lamin, and Vimentin as Universal Dystrophic Markers
Proteomic profiling of the dystrophin complex and membrane fraction from dystrophic mdx muscle reveals decreases in the cytolinker desmoglein and increases in the extracellular matrix stabilizers biglycan and fibronectin
Congenital muscle dystrophy and diet consistency affect mouse skull shape differently
