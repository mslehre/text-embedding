Toward the Relevance of Platelet Subpopulations for Transfusion Medicine.
Role of Platelet Size Revisited-Function and Protein Composition of Large and Small Platelets.
Activated platelets kill Staphylococcus aureus, but not Streptococcus pneumoniae - The role of Fc?RIIa and platelet factor 4/heparin-antibodies.
Pneumolysin induces platelet destruction, not platelet activation, which can be prevented by immunoglobulin preparations in vitro.
Function of Large and Small Platelets Differs, Depending on Extracellular Calcium Availability and Type of Inductor.
