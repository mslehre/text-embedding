The N-terminal CCHC zinc finger motif mediates homodimerization of the transcription factor BCL11B.
Unveiling the N-Terminal Homodimerization of BCL11B by Hybrid Solvent Replica-Exchange Simulations.
Nuclear import of BCL11B is mediated by a classical nuclear localization signal and not the Kr√ºppel-like zinc fingers
