Characterisation of the conformational changes in platelet factor 4 induced by polyanions: towards in vitro prediction of antigenicity.
Binding of anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies depends on the thermodynamics of conformational changes in platelet factor 4.
Polyphosphates form antigenic complexes with platelet factor 4 (PF4) and enhance PF4-binding to bacteria.
