Proliferation of C6 glioma cells requires the phospholipid remodeling enzyme tafazzin independent of cardiolipin composition.
Re-Expression of Tafazzin Isoforms in TAZ-Deficient C6 Glioma Cells Restores Cardiolipin Composition but Not Proliferation Rate and Alterations in Gene Expression
Mechanical characterization of isolated mitochondria under conditions of oxidative stress.
Corrigendum: Re-expression of tafazzin isoforms in TAZ-deficient C6 glioma cells restores cardiolipin composition but not proliferation rate and alterations in gene expression.
